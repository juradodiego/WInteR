WInteR: Widley Intelligent Reader

## Winter is an NLP-powered artificial intelligence

## It will be able to be applied as a neural filter to sift trough disinformation in the media.

Ethical Concerns:
An ethical dilemma arises in the definition of what is useful information and what is disinformation, as several different scenarios may arise.


Pragmatics:
Essentially will be broken down into a classification task: i.e. udeful information or disinformation
However, we will not simply classify, rather attempt to find the useful information within the disinformation.
Pragmatically, a passage will be given to Winter, and then it will divide the text in a binary search approach to classify each segement in the string as misinformation.
Return a summarization of useful information and disinformation index corresponding to the original passage.
