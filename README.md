Winter stands for Widley Intelligent Reader

Winter is an NLP-powered artificial intelligence

It will be able to be applied as a neural filter to sift trough disinformation in the media.

An ethical dilemma arises in the definition of what is useful information and what is disinformation, as several different scenarios may arise.
Essentially will be broken down into a classification task: i.e. udeful information or disinformation
However, we will not simply classify, rather attempt to find the useful information within the disinformation.
Pragmatically, a passage will be given to Winter, and then it will divide the text in a binary search approach to classify each segement in the string as misinformation.
Return a summarization of useful information and disinformation index corresponding to the original passage.
